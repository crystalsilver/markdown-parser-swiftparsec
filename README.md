Learning about Parser Combinators by building a basic Markdown parser in Swift using [SwiftParsec](https://github.com/davedufresne/SwiftParsec).

The test parses a simple markdown file `basic.md` that includes the following types of elements:

- headers
- paragraphs
- unordered lists
- ordered lists
